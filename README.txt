ProActive Workflows & Scheduling {version}

Thanks for your interest in ProActive Scheduling.

*** Quick start

    To run ProActive Scheduler (server part):
        $> ./bin/server

    This will start all components, including 4 local nodes and Web portals.
    URLs to access them will be displayed in the server's output.

    From here you can submit a job to the Scheduler, using for instance the
    XML file in samples/jobs_descriptors/Job_PI.xml

    To run the command line client:
    $> ./bin/client

    To start a node:
